# Project Plan

# Title :
 "Reducing Hospital Readmissions through Demographic Analysis"

## Summary
In this project, you will leverage the Hospital Readmissions Data along with the US Census Bureau Healthcare Dataset to identify demographic factors that may be correlated with higher rates of hospital readmissions. The objective is to develop insights that can inform targeted interventions to reduce readmissions and improve patient outcomes.

# Datasources
## Dataset: Hospital Readmissions Data
